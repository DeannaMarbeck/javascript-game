## A simple game created with javascript and canvas

After working through the MDN javascript game tutorial I wanted to practice by creating my own game.

The player can move the cookie monster around the screen to avoid being hit by the pizza.  The pizza automatically changes direction when it reaches the canvas border.  The cookie monster is controlled using the arrow keys.  When both icons are in the same space, a life is lost and the cookie monster flashes red.

Creating this simple game gave me experience using canvas, javascript animation loops and event handlers, collision detection, and controlling speed and direction.
